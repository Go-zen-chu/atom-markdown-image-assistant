# [atom-markdown-image-assistant](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-image-assistant)

Add sane drag and drop and copy/paste support for images to markdown
files. This is especially useful for notetaking in Atom.

Whenever an image is dragged and dropped or copy and pasted on an open
markdown file, this package automatically copies it to an `assets/` folder
in the current directory, renames the image, and inserts a relative link
to the image.
